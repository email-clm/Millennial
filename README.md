# Millennial

February 21, 2025, negative f_LM_MI_sor in the majority of sites and over time (in Guo's sutdy); this needs to be resolved in next version.

August 18 2021. Added GitHub repository to the model version 2.0.

Updates on May 27, 2019 
Few bugs were identified and were fixed. 
Note: This model is one example of the Millennial framework and multiple people are actively developing it. People who are interested in following the model development can keep an eye on all of these repositories. The recent update of the Millennial model (version 2.0) can be accessed at: https://github.com/rabramoff/Millennial

This is a repository for the newly developed Millennial model (version 1.0)

The Millennial model is a product of the third group of participants for the International Decade of Soils (IDOS) workshop held in Boulder, CO during Mar 14-16. The model was conceived by the entire group including Rose Abramoff, Sarah O'Brien, Eric Davidson, Wenting Feng, Adrien Finzi, Melannie Hartman, Daryl Moorhead, Josh Schimel, Melanie Mayes, and Xiaofeng Xu. The code is created in May - June 2016, by Xiaofeng Xu (xxu@sdsu.edu). The model has been updated with several modifications on processes and parameters during May 2016 - January 2017. 

Contact Xiaofeng Xu for any technical questions or if you want to test this model.
